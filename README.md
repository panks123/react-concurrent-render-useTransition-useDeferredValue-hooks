# Concurrent Rendering in React

With Concurrent Rendering, React can:

âœ… Pause and resume rendering

âœ… Prioritize urgent updates (e.g., user interactions over slow data fetching)

âœ… Improve performance on slow devices and networks

With Concurrent Rendering, React can split work into smaller chunks and pause if needed.

For example, React provides `useTransition` and `useDeferredValue` Hooks for delaying some updates or making them lower priority.

---

## **useTransition Hook**

It allows React to prioritize urgent updates (like user input) and delay non-urgent updates (like expensive calculations).

```jsx
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
```

- `isPending` - A flag that indicates whether a transition is in progress.
- `startTransition` - A function that makes a state update lower priority. It takes a callback as an argument, and any state updates inside the callback will be deferred.

### **Example**
```jsx
const [query, setQuery] = useState("");
const [list, setList] = useState([]);
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

const onSearch = (val) => {
  setQuery(val);
  startTransition(() => {
    const filteredList = largeDataset.filter(item => item.includes(val));
    setList(filteredList);
  });
};
```

ðŸ”¹ Here, `query` updates immediately, ensuring a smooth input experience, while filtering the large dataset is deferred.

## **useDeferredValue Hook**

`useDeferredValue` delays a value update until more urgent updates (like user interactions) are complete. It is useful when passing a frequently changing value to an expensive computation or rendering process.

```jsx
const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(value);
```

- `useDeferredValue(value)` returns a **delayed version** of `value` that updates **after** higher-priority updates are processed.
- It is useful for preventing expensive calculations from blocking UI updates.

### **Example**
```jsx
const [query, setQuery] = useState("");
const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);
const filteredList = largeDataset.filter(item => item.includes(deferredQuery));
```

ðŸ”¹ `query` updates instantly, so the input feels responsive, while `filteredList` updates with a slight delay, preventing UI lag.

## **When to Use These Hooks?**

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `useTransition` | Used to mark a state update as low priority to keep UI interactions smooth. |
| `useDeferredValue` | Used to delay a value update so expensive computations do not block rendering. |

Both hooks help React manage rendering efficiently, ensuring smooth interactions even with complex updates. ðŸš€
